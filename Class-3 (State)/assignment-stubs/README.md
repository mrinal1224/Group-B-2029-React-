# Class 3 — Assignment stubs

These files are **incomplete**. Your task is to complete them according to the instructions in **Class-3-Assignments.md**.

## How to use

1. Open **Class-3-Assignments.md** and read the problem statement and ask for the assignment you’re doing.
2. Copy the corresponding stub file from this folder into your project’s **src/components/** (e.g. copy `Assignment1-Counter.jsx` to `state/src/components/`).
3. Complete all parts marked with `// TODO` so the component works as described.
4. In **App.jsx**, import and render the component to test (e.g. `import Counter from './components/Assignment1-Counter'` or rename the file to `Counter.jsx` and use `import Counter from './components/Counter'`).

You can either work in this folder and then copy completed files into `state/src/components/`, or copy the stub into `state/src/components/` first and edit there.
